<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Bogdan Marius, i'm a 29 years old man born in Bucharest, Romania.<br/>
  I've been doing sports since i was a kid (started at 7 years old) and i manage<br/> 
  to excel in diving.<br/>
  After lots of training i manage to get only 1st places in every competition.<br/>
  In the years of 2013 (included) and 2014 (included) i have been awarded 2 diplomas<br/>
   of "Absolute Champion" from the federal institution of diving because i managed to get<br/>
    ONLY 1st place in every competition held in those 2 years consecutive.
</p>
<p>After quitting performance diving at 18 years old I started to do diving shows in other<br/> 
  countries because i needed an income due to the inability of my familly to provide me with one.<br/>
  At 29 years old i decided to quit this job and follow my dream job which I wanted to do since I<br/> 
  was a kid because now i have a familly of my own and i want to spend more<br/>
  time with my wife and child.<br/>
  I used to play on computers since i was 4 years old, and i was always interested in how the mechanics behind<br/>
   the programs I'm using.<br/>
  I'm a very loyal and hard working person. I always like to finish what i started because i'm aware of the joy<br/>
   i feel at the end of it.
